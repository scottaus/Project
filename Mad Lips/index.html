<!-- Two Noun, both alike in dignity,
In fair Place, where we lay our scene,
From ancient Noun break to new mutiny,
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
A pair of star-cross`d Nouns take their life;
Whole misadventured piteous overthrows
Do with their Noun bury their parents` strife.
The fearful passage of their ADJECTIVE love,
And the continuance of their parents` rage,
Which, but their children`s end, nought could VERB,
Is now the NUMBER hours` traffic of our stage;
The which if you with ADJECTIVE BODY PART attend,
What here shall VERB, our toil shall strive to mend.	 -->
